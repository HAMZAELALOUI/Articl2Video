NO HUMAN FACES - avoid all facial features, portraits, or front-facing people\n2. NO TEXT OR WRITTEN WORDS - no books with visible text, no documents with writing, no signs\n3. NO MAPS as main or prominent elements - no geographical displays, atlases, or cartographic elements\n4. NO SPECIFIC PLACE NAMES - don't mention cities, countries, or specific locations by name\n\nDESCRIPTION STRUCTURE:\n- ALWAYS start with the main symbolic object or focal point FIRST\n- Then describe secondary elements around this focal point\n- Secondary elements should be visible and clear, not excessively blurred\n- Be specific and clear about what the main focus of the image should be\n- Use precise descriptive language for colors, textures, lighting, and composition\n- Describe EXACTLY how the image should look to represent the text content\n\nPEOPLE AND SYMBOLS IN IMAGES:\n- People can be included from the side view or from far away\n- People should NEVER be the main focus of the image\n- Prefer showing people from behind, with hands performing actions, or as distant silhouettes\n- NEVER show anyone's face, not even in profile or blurred\n- Flags CAN be included as secondary objects if relevant to the story (placed to the side, slightly blurred)\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Output ONLY ONE PARAGRAPH, 60-100 words total\n2. NO SECTION HEADERS anywhere in your response - do not use SCENE:, FOCAL ELEMENTS:, COMPOSITION:, TECH:, STYLE:, or NEGATIVE: headings\n3. Start with \"Vertical 4K editorial photograph of...\"\n4. End with \"Shot with [camera specs]. \u2013ar 9:16 \u2013quality 4k\"\n\nSAFE ALTERNATIVES TO PROHIBITED ELEMENTS:\n- Instead of faces: people shown only from behind, hands performing actions, silhouettes at distance\n- Instead of text: blank papers, unmarked documents, closed books, abstract patterns\n- Instead of maps: natural landscapes, architectural elements, symbolic objects\n- Instead of place names: use general terms like \"urban setting,\" \"rural landscape,\" \"coastal area\"\n-be precise and specific when describing somthing do not drop locations names or acronyme\n\n\u274c INCORRECT FORMAT (DO NOT DO THIS):\nSCENE: Parliamentary office at day.\nFOCAL ELEMENTS: Legal documents, gavel.\nCOMPOSITION: Rule of thirds.\nTECH: Canon EOS R5, 50mm lens.\nSTYLE: Documentary realism.\n\n\u2705 CORRECT FORMAT (DO THIS):\n\"Vertical 4K editorial photograph of a wooden gavel resting on a polished marble surface, symbolizing judicial authority. The gavel's rich oak texture catches warm directional light from the right. Around it, stacks of unmarked legal documents and amendments spread across the table. A pair of reading glasses and a fountain pen lie nearby. In the background, two figures in dark suits discuss matters, shown only from behind. A subtle red, white and blue flag is partially visible on a stand in the corner. Shot with Canon EOS R5, 50mm lens, f/4.0 aperture. \u2013ar 9:16 \u2013quality 4k\"\n"
