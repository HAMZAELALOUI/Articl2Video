# Fixes for JSON Parsing Errors in Article2Video

## Problem
The application was encountering a JSON parsing error: "Expecting ',' delimiter: line 3 column 4952 (char 4968)" when processing OpenAI API responses. This was caused by improperly formatted JSON with unescaped quotes in string values and possibly missing commas between array items.

## Solution
We implemented several fixes to address the JSON parsing issues:

### 1. Improved JSON Cleanup Functions
- Enhanced `fix_json_quotes()` function in `json_utils.py` to better handle different types of quote escaping patterns
- Added more robust regex patterns to identify and fix common JSON errors
- Implemented a multi-step parsing approach with fallbacks for different error types
- Added additional cleanup for trailing commas, missing commas, and improperly terminated brackets

### 2. Updated the OpenAI Prompt
- Modified the prompt in `openai_summarization_prompt.py` to provide clearer instructions on proper JSON formatting
- Added explicit examples of correctly escaped quotes in JSON
- Added detailed guidelines about comma usage between array items
- Provided an example of proper JSON array formatting with commas

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added a new `safely_parse_json()` function in `openai_client.py` that tries multiple parsing approaches
- Implemented better error reporting and fallback mechanisms
- Updated the parsing logic to handle different types of JSON responses

### 4. Text Overlay Enhancement
- Updated the regex pattern in `text_overlay.py` to recognize differently quoted/escaped keywords
- Improved the handling of quoted text in slides to support all forms of quotes:
  - Regular quotes: "word"
  - Escaped quotes: \"word\"
  - Double-escaped quotes: \\"word\\"
- Updated the highlight color to #79C910 as requested

## Testing
Created a test script `test_json_fix.py` to verify the fixes with various error scenarios:
- Unescaped quotes within string values
- Missing commas between array items
- Unclosed brackets
- Double-escaped quotes
- Trailing commas
- Nested quotes with different escaping

## Results
The improvements should make the application more robust when handling JSON responses from the OpenAI API, particularly for responses that contain quoted keywords in multiple languages.
